# What I learned

React made it easy to manage states and component lifecycles.\
I have understood that there are functions that are known as hooks which can hanlde that.\
These are UseState, UseEffect, and useRef to manage states and lifecycle of the app\

so in my case 
I used useState to update counter variable\
I used useEffect to update document title when counter is changed\
I used useRef to grab button Element and change its background color when it is clicked\
